          Hello, I'm Ken. I am a developer living in the Sacramento area. I graduated from Dev Bootcamp in San Francisco and continued improving my skills and learning new skills primarily through hack-a-thon competitions and self-educating. I have worked on facial recognition, voice recognition and data visualization tasks for various projects. I also enjoy creating beautiful and useful things as a hobby, growing up Napa I draw inspiration from nature and it is reflected in the aesthetics of the décor pieces I build. My travel experiences and interest in other cultures inspires me to think outside of box and find new uses for everyday items such as my wine barrel decor pieces. My extensive experience training others in my previous jobs has helped me develop my communication skills and allows me to thrive in a team environment. I also get great satisfaction seeing somebody that I trained succeed.
